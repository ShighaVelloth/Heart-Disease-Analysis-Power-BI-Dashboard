**Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard**
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing heart disease patient data to uncover key health patterns and survival indicators. The dashboard visualizes insights from patient demographics, survival rates, and medical conditions like serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, diabetes, anaemia, and smoking habits.
The goal of this analysis is to help medical professionals, researchers, and analysts understand which factors contribute significantly to survival outcomes and how age and health conditions influence recovery.

**Dashboard Highlights**
* Overall Survival Rate and Average Age of Survivors

* Survival by Age Group

* Average Serum Creatinine & Ejection Fraction by Age

* Health Risk Factors by Age Group (Smoking, Diabetes, Anaemia, High BP)

* Gender-based data segmentation

 **Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project contains medical and demographic information of heart failure patients.
